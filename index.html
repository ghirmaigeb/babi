                <p class="one">MasterFormat is a coding system for organizing construction documents, contracts, design
                    specifications, and operational manuals. It uses specific numbers and associated titles that make up
                    a universal indexing system. MasterFormat is also a publication created and maintained by the
                    Construction Specification Institute (CSI) and Construction Specifications Canada (CSC). It is
                    widely used in the construction and operation of buildings and systems in a variety of industries
                    and projects, from hospitals and public infrastructure to schools and residential construction.</p>

                <h1>Advantages of Using MasterFormat</h1>
                <p class="two">One of the most important benefits of MasterFormat is improved communication between project groups,
                    most notably between the design and construction teams. It allows all team members to refer to
                    specific sections of any document using the universal coding system. This facilitates coordination
                    and communication between project owners, architects, contractors, and suppliers, minimizing the
                    time spent organizing documents.


                    For industries with complex operations, such as health care, MasterFormat helps communicate and
                    organize critical operational information among designers, builders, operations managers, and
                    facility owners. In addition, as these and many other industries are increasingly using building
                    information modeling, or BIM, MasterFormat can be used by modeling software to enhance data
                    interoperability and improve BIM adoption</p>

                <h1>Steps to Building a House</h1>
                <p>One of the amazing things about American homes is that the huge majority of them are built using
                    completely standardized building practices. One reason for this consistency is a set of uniform
                    building codes that apply across the country. Another reason is cost -- the techniques used to build
                    homes produce reliable housing quickly at a low cost (relatively speaking). If you ever watch any
                    house being built, you will find that it goes through the following steps:.</p>
